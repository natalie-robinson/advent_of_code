Code challenges for the Advent of Code series

Each year I start the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) series for a fun side project. I do the problems slowly and in my spare time, which I have very little of. I inevitably only make it part way through, and have fun tackling the challenges even if I don't really have time for them.
